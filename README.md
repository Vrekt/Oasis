# Oasis
A multiplayer game using libGDX and Netty.

# What is it
Firstly, the project name is just a placeholder, it will probably change later.

Currently there is only a few things implemented
  - Handshaking
  - Creating/Joining lobbies
  - Player movement and velocity
  - Disconnecting (sorta)
  
Currently, by default client tries to connect to "localhost:8090"
  
# TODO
[x] Lobby input codes, currently default is just 9999 for every client
[x] Sync player movements, you can see others move its just not synced
[ ] Collision in lobby
[ ] Remove players collision
[ ] Add next stage of game
  
# Whats planned
[ ] Playing levels with multiple people
[x] Lobby support
[ ] etc

If anything, this will be a good source if you need to see some example code or get stuck on a problem.
