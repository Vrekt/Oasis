# Oasis
A multiplayer game using libGDX and Netty.

# What is it
Firstly, the project name is just a placeholder, it will probably change later.

Currently there is only a few things implemented
  - Server/Client handshake
  - Client > Server create lobby
  - Disconnects
  
# Whats planned
  - Playing levels with multiple people
  - Lobby support
  - etc

If anything, this will be a good source if you need to see some example code or get stuck on a problem.
